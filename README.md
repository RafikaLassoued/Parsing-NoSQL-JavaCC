# Parsing_NoSQL_JavaCC
Simple example NoSQL Query(Insert) use Java Compiler Compiler
Parsing the statement of NoSQL Query using Java CC :
Java Compiler Compiler (JavaCC) is the most popular parser generator for use with Java applications.A parser generator is a tool that reads a grammar specification and converts it to a Java program that can recognize matches to the grammar.
You specify a languageâ€™s lexical and syntactic description in a JJ file, then run javacc on the JJ file. You will get seven java files as output, including a lexer and a parser.
JavaCC is similar to yacc in that it generates a parser from a formal grammar written in EBNF notation.
Compilers have to perform three major tasks when presented with a program text (source code)  :
1. Lexical analysis.
2. Syntactic analysis.
3. Code generation or execution .
